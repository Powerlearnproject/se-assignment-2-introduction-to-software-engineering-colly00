# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
this is a branch of science that deals with design, development, testing and maintanace of software application
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles to software development, focusing on systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approaches to create reliable and efficient software.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Flexibility: Agile is flexible and adaptive to changes; Waterfall is rigid with fixed requirements.
Development Approach: Agile uses iterative cycles; Waterfall uses a linear, step-by-step approach.
Customer Involvement: Agile involves customers throughout the development; Waterfall typically involves customers only at the beginning and end.
Risk Management: Agile identifies and addresses risks early and continuously; Waterfall addresses risks in the initial planning phase.
Minimal Documentation: Focuses on working software over extensive documentation, although documentation is still important.
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements engineering plays a crucial role in the software development life cycle (SDLC) by defining and understanding the customer's needs and desires, as well as facilitating communication between stakeholders and the development team.
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
Unit Testing, System Testing, Integration Testing, and Acceptance Testing. Every testing level is crucial testing for software testing but these four levels of testing are crucial testing for software engineering
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter.
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
Project Planning. ...
Team Management. ...
Stakeholder Management. ...
Risk Management. ...
Budget and Resource Allocation. ...
Quality Assurance. ...
Progress Monitoring and Reporting. ...
Change Management.
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Software maintenance is done after the product has launched for several reasons including improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance, and more.
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? As software becomes entrenched in every aspect of the human experience, developers have an ethical responsibility to their customers.
addictive design;
corporate ownership of personal data;
algorithmic bias;
weak cyber security and personally identifiable information (PII) protection; and.
overemphasis on features.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
